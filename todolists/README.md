## Assignment for Module #2: Active Record Relationships

The overall goal of this assignment is to assess your ability to implement and use Active Record model relationships. 
This includes:

  * Creating Active Record models and relationships between the models using a rails-provided generator (`rails g model` or `rails g scaffold`)
  * Providing validations for models (using built-in Active Record validations as well as custom validations)
  * Implementing a grandparent relationship with a `:through` option
  * Providing bootstrap data using a `seeds.rb` file
  * Implementing `default_scope` queries
  * Implementing aggregation queries
  * Implementing advanced queries (e.g., SQL snippets)
  * Implementing model/database (DB) cascades

The functional goal of this assignment is to implement relationships and 
query behavior for the following four (4) model classes

  1. User
